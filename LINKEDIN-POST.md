## 🇦🇱 I built AlbSub because Albanian subtitles basically don't exist.

Last night at 1 AM, I wanted to watch an old Italian comedy — *Christmas in Love* (2004) with Boldi & De Sica. Classic cinepanettone. Problem: English subtitles don't exist. Albanian subtitles? Forget about it.

I scraped every subtitle database on the internet. OpenSubtitles, Subscene, Podnapisi — nothing. So I grabbed the Italian .srt file and built a translation pipeline using LLMs. 15 minutes later, I had working English subs.

Then it hit me: **Albanian is one of the most underserved languages in the global subtitle ecosystem.**

There are 10M+ Albanian speakers worldwide. We grow up watching Italian comedies, Turkish dramas, Greek films. But Albanian subtitle support is virtually nonexistent. What does exist is often machine-translated garbage that butchers humor, context, and natural speech.

So I built **AlbSub** — an open-source CLI tool that translates subtitle files (.srt) into Albanian using any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, etc.).

What makes it different from Google Translate:
→ Contextual translation (the LLM reads surrounding dialogue for continuity)
→ Natural, colloquial Albanian — not stiff word-for-word translation
→ Strict validation — every subtitle block is checked for dropped lines
→ Works with any source language (Italian, English, Turkish, Greek, French...)
→ Bring your own model — OpenAI, Anthropic, or local via Ollama

The implications for Albanian cultural accessibility are huge. Students studying foreign cinema. The diaspora consuming media in languages they half-understand. Older generations locked out entirely.

Every language deserves subtitles. 🔥
