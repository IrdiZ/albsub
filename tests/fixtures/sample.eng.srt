1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Good morning everyone!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,200
How are you today?
Everything okay?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,800
<i>I can't believe
this happened.</i>

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,300
[Marco] Where did you go yesterday?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
I went to the market
with my mother.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,200
<b>Attention!</b> This is important.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
[Julia] I don't like
this place.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,300
We need to leave right away.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,800
<i>Life is beautiful,</i>
but also difficult.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,200
[Marco] You're right.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
I remember when we were
young and happy.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Those times will never return.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
<i>Maybe one day
everything will change.</i>

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,300
[Julia] I really hope so.
With all my heart.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Let's go home, it's late.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,200
<b>Don't forget</b> the keys!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,500
[Marco] I already took them.
Don't worry.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Thank you for everything, my friend.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,800
<i>And so ends
another day.</i>

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,200
Good night everyone.
